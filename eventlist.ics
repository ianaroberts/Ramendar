 S-1467>\n\nA great photo will add significant value to any communication
  project—yet \ngetting that perfect photo can be a significant challenge
 . We often find \nourselves searching endless photo libraries of un-usea
 ble options\, spending \nhundreds of dollars for a high-end stock photo\
 , or stressing about copyrights \nof images found online. \n\nImagine gr
 abbing your smart phone or DSLR camera\, stepping out of the office \nan
 d getting the perfect photo for all your communication needs. Learn how 
 the \nnewest technology (hardware and software) will help you create pro
 fessional \nlooking photos. \n\nWe will cover the entire digital process
  from start to finish\, to get the \nright image for your project.\n\nLe
 arn how camera phone & photography basics\, such as composition\, lighti
 ng\, \ndepth of field\, and manual focus can impact the quality of your 
 picture.  We \nwill also discuss photo-organization\, HDR\, and the late
 st 3rd party apps to \ntransform your smartphone into a pro camera.\n\nL
 aptops are recommended\, but not required.\n

SUMMARY:Sound Immersion Experience - Gongs & Singing Bowls
UID:events_stanford_edu_69993
DESCRIPTION:\nGuests will lay down in Savasana to experience the sound vi
 brations of Singing \nBowls\, Gongs and Chimes as they guide us into a d
 eep meditation. The healing \nvibrations pass through our bodies\, openi
 ng blockages and allowing our minds to \nquiet. A wide range of ancient 
 world traditions from Confucianism to the \nPythagoreans' claimed that s
 ound could not only “tune the soul” but affect our \ncosmological & soci
 al worlds as well. The physiological impact of sound on the \nbody\, emo
 tions & cognition is apparent. Through the vibrations of these \ninstrum
 ents we experience an inner calm and deep relaxation that enables us to 
 \njourney within and center.\n\nPlease bring a yoga mat/blanket/pillow f
 or your comfort.\n\nDanny Goldberg offers the Sound Immersion Experience

 ais\, while also considering the artist’s working processes and use of t
 he \nfragmented body to convey emotional states. \n\nIMAGE: Auguste Rodi

SUMMARY:The Living Constitution's Dead Hand

DESCRIPTION:\nThose who study and think about the Constitution often ask:
   Why does a \ndocument written more than two hundred years ago continue
  to bind us today?  A \nprominent answer has been that ours is a "living
  constitution"--one that adapts \nand changes over time.  But does livin
 g constitutionalism as practiced by the \nSupreme Court really solve the
  problem of the dead hand of the past or might \nit\, at times\, risk ac
 centuating that problem?\n\nPlease join Stanford Law School and the Stan
 ford Constitutional Law Center for \nour annual Constitution Day Lecture
 . Our speaker will be John Manning\, renowned \nlegal scholar and Dean o
 f Harvard Law School\, who will present a lecture \nentitled The Living 
 Constitution's Dead Hand. Prof. Manning's lecture will take \nplace from
  4:30-5:30pm in Paul Brest Hall\, with a reception to follow.\n
